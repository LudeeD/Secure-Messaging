# Security Project

## Intro
The objective of this project is to develop a system enabling users to exchange messages asynchronously. 
Messages are sent and received through a non-trustworthy central repository, which keeps messages for users until they fetch them. The resulting system is composed by a Rendezvous Point, or Server, and several clients exchanging messages.

## Features
- Message confidentiality, integrity and authentication
- Message delivery confirmation
- Identity preservation ( Citizen Card )

## Deploy
#### Server
run the ./runserver script with sudo to compile and run the server
#### Client
run the ./runclient script to compile and run the client

## More Info
See report for implementation details
